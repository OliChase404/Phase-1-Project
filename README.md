# Phase-1-Project


Recipe Search: 

A search tool that accesses a database of 2.3 millions recipes. 


User Story:

As a user I can search the database using a broad range of search filters in categories such as geographical origin, meal type, health labels and dietary preferences. 

I can also enter my own search terms into the search bar, these can be ingredients, types of meal or other personal preferences. 

I can enter a list of the ingredients I currently have in my kitchen and view recipes I can make with those ingredients.  

I can save my favorite recipes to the my favorites sidebar on the right side of the page so that I can access them again in the future. My saved recipe list will persist between browser sessions so I will not lose my saved recipes if I restart my computer.  

The search returns randomised results based on the search criteria so I will always see new recipes even if I run the same search multiple times. 

Also, the site features infinite scroll so when I perform a search, I can keep viewing matching results without having to search again or navigate through multiple pages. 

When I click on a recipe, a popup window opens which displays the ingredients list for the recipe and gives me the option to save the recipe to my favorites list and the option to view the recipe on its origin page.
